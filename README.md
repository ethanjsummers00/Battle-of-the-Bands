# Battle-of-the-Bands

<h1>Objectives</h1>
                <p>
                    A senior capstone design project, I chose to develop a site for a Battle of the Bands music
                    festival that would take place in Mesa, AZ. I prototyped and coded three responisve pagesfor this site.

                <p>
                    I developed a general structure for the pages by sketching them out and designing wireframes
                    in Figma, and developing a color and font system meanmt to reflect a punk, rock and roll tone.
                    After taking feedback on the initial designs I developed prototypes that I then developed into an html5 
                    website that displays info about the festival.
